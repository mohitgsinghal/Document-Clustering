# Document-Clustering
In this we do a simple experiment of representing a text using different representations like "Glove Average Embeddings" and famous "Doc2Vec"'s different versions and cluster them using K-Means Algorithm. For this we took 20NewsGroup Dataset having news text categorized into 20 classes like "sports", 'Tech' etc.
